- Originally developed by hypermorphicmods, Nexus Mod Page: [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelsspidermanremastered/mods/2431)


# New features

- You can use hashes.txt from the [Modding Tool](https://github.com/Tkachov/Overstrike/tree/main/ModdingTool) to enable the existing autocompletion feature. Simply put them in the same directory.
- Enhanced support for different game's materials. Previously uncompatible MSM2 materials can now be loaded and edited without issues.
- Reduced memory usage when handling hashes for autocompletion.
- Enhanced dark theme and improved UI designed to mimic QT's design.
- Split container for string and numeric inputs.
- Over 14,000 of Spider-Man's IDs.

# Usage
Click "Load File" to start loading the file. If everything goes through correctly you should see the material's numeric and string inputs on the top and bottom panels.
You can resize these panels by positioning your cursor very slightly above the bottom panel.

### Options
- Autocomplete fields = When editing an external template override string, it'll open a search box that'll let you select any texture in hashes.txt.
- Universal header = This is an option for MSM2 files to replace the header with an universally compatible one.

# FAQ

## Why is Spandex Luna showing errors when loading certain materials?
Ensure that you’re using supported material types (RCRA, MSMR, MSMM, and MSM2). If errors persist, confirm that the file isn't corrupted and matches the game's original structure.
